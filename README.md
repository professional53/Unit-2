# Unit 2 Class Code

## First time
* i forked it i REALLY did!!!!! I really forked it!!!
* Go to **When you get home** section

## When you get home
* Open the repo in GitHub if you are using CodeSpaces
* Edit files, do work, etc.
* Commit changes, push to repo when done
* Go to **When you get to class** section

## When you get to class
* Open IntelliJ
* Make sure you are in the project you should be in for the Unit we are in
* Pull changes from your repo (Git>Pull)
* Get changes from my repo (the one you forked from) by going to Git>Update Project
  * You cannot pull from a repo you do not own; you can make a request, but I will deny it
* Follow along in class, do code, have fun
* Push changes back to your repo before leaving class
* Go to **When you get home** section, rinse, repeat
